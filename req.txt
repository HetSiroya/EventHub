Absolutely! Here's a more unique and practical project idea that combines all your topics (Multer, Token, Aggregate, Lookup, Middleware, Socket.io, Nodemailer, Sharp) in a meaningful and modern way:

📱 Project Idea: EventHub – Smart Event Sharing & Networking App

🎯 Concept:
A platform where users can create and manage events (e.g., workshops, parties, webinars), upload posters or banners, invite others, and chat in real-time. It also sends email invites, uses profile pictures, and performs smart analytics like most active users and popular events.

🔍 Features That Use All Your Topics:

✅ User Auth & Profiles (Token + Middleware)

JWT-based login/signup.

Middleware to protect routes.

Upload profile pictures (Multer + Sharp for compression). 

✅ Event Creation (Multer + Sharp + Lookup)

Users create events with image posters.

Use $lookup to show user + event details in a single query.

✅ Email Invitations (Node mailer)

When a user creates an event, invitees receive a custom email with event info.

✅ Dashboard Stats (Aggregation)

Use MongoDB $aggregate to show:

Most popular events (by attendees)

Most active users

Number of events created per month

✅ Secure APIs (Middleware + Token)

Only event creators can update/delete events.

Participants can only join events they are invited to.

✅ Event Media Gallery (Multer)

Upload multiple images per event.
